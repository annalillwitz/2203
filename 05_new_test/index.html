  ## Week 5: 

  ### Monday:
  No class: Indiginous People's Day




  ### Wednesday:

  We tested our new prototype reflector, while I was able to take pictures with our FLIR camera. It was not 
  able to boil water, unfortunately. We hypothesized that this was due to the smaller surface area of the 
  mirror. I also noticed that the acrylic mirror was actually warmer than the large reflector we tested on 
  Week 3. The warmest spot on our prototype reflector was 30.6 degrees Celsius, while the large reflector 
  from week 3 had a warmest spot of 26.1 degrees Celsius. This might also be a contributing factor for 
  the water not boiling. The surface temperature of the pot was also very different (57.2 degrees Celsius 
  today vs 71.3 degrees Celsius with the large reflector). We therefore must raise the surface temperature 
  of the pot by around 15 degrees Celsius in order to boil water.

  We also printed out the new holder designed on Week 3 and worked on putting together the framework mentioned 
  there.
