  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  ## Monday:
  We got into groups and began discussing different aspects of design that could 
  be used for our solar cooker prototype. I worked with Brittany McHenry on 
  discussing how we could create mirrors. We researched how we could grind a small 
  mirror out of glass to use as a satellite mirror.  We also discussed how to build
  a turntable. This could be used to pour epoxy in a parabolic shape, which 
  could then be covered by a reflective material. We could use this as our main 
  parabolic mirror.

  We also worked on creating a website to use in this class. I created a github 
  repository but was not able to get it working.

  Here is a	[link to the website with instructions on how to grind a mirror by hand](https://www.instructables.com/Grind-and-Polish-a-DobsonianNewtonian-Telescope-Mi/).


  ## Wednesday:

  We looked at various examples of solar cookers bought from Amazon.com. We got
  into groups to help assemble two of them. I worked on the yellow folding solar 
  cooker. After this one was fully built, we took the yellow folding solar cooker and
  another one (which I will refer to as the pre-assembled one) outside to test them. 
  We put an equal amount of water in both of them and recorded the temperatures of 
  the water at various times. It was determined that the pre-assembled solar cooker 
  was more effective than the yellow folding one at heating up water. However, we 
  hypothesized that using a black pot instead of a metallic one to hold the water for 
  the yellow solar cooker might change the results a little.


  Here are some images of our solar cookers:
