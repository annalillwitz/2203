  ## Week 13: 

  ### Monday:
  We started assembling our prototype. I helped drill holes and countersink them into a 
  hinge in order to attach our motor to it. Catherine helped cut the parts of the 
  telescoping rods we had into the right length.

  We also found that the lead screw fit inside our new lead screw holder, and the lead screw
  holder fit inside the upper part of the telescoping rod.

  ### Wednesday:

  Catherine and I helped drill more holes and screw together parts. We attached our lead 
  screw holder to the upper part of the telescoping rod. We also had to countersink the 
  holes so the heads of the screws would fit inside the lower part of the telescoping rod. 
  We also drilled holes and screwed the 3D printed part that sits on top of the motor to 
  the lower part of the telescoping rod. We also attached that 3D printed part in the 
  stepper motor. In addition, we also connected the threaded rod to the motor and to the 
  lead screw. By getting the motor to turn, we were able to lower the upper part of the 
  telescoping rod into the lower part. Our attitude adjuster was finished and just needed 
  to be connected to the rest of the prototype.

  On Sunday, Catherine and I drilled holes and attached the hinge on the stepper motor to 
  the base on our prototype. We also helped attach a gear onto the prototype and attached 
  5/6 ball bearings onto the base with epoxy.
