  ## Week 3: 

  ### Monday:
  We continued to test the three solar cookers (the GoSun/small solar cooker, the All Season Solar Cooker(yellow 
  solar cooker, and the LiFuJunDong 1800W Solar Cooker/the large solar cooker). It was sunny outside, so the large 
  solar cooker was successfully able to boil water after a reasonable amount of time. The other two were much slower, 
  with the small solar cooker doing better than the yellow solar cooker. 

  I have included pictures from using the FLIR camera:

  ![The yellow solar cooker](./Yellow_testing_3.JPG)

  All three pictures were taken at 4:04pm. In each, I used FLIR to measure the warmest, coldest, and a middling 
  temperature on the surface of the solar cookers. We once again noticed that the smallest solar cooker is the 
  only one with the warmest spot on the mirror. The other two have the warmest spot on the metal pot, but the 
  small solar cooker uses a plastic tube to hold water instead, which seems to heat up less.


  ### Wednesday:

  Christine and I learned about stepper motors. We then worked on using Arduino to write a simple program 
  that turns the stepper motor based on data gathered from a photoresistor circuit. With some more work, 
  this can be used to create a tracking method so our prototype solar cooker will always be able to point 
  at the sun. The photoresistor prototype already existed from the previous semesterâ€™s class. In the 
  future, we will probably try to improve the design.
