  ## Week 9: 

  ### Monday:
  I partnered with Catherine to work on the azimuth angle tracking system. Going off of the designs we had 
  previously talked about, we discussed how lead screws/threaded rods could be implemented. We also examined 
  the large solar tracker obtained from Amazon in order to see how a lead screw could be used to adjust the 
  azimuth angle and talked about how this would be relevant to our design. We noticed that we would need two 
  hinges on either side of our extendable bar in order for our design to work. We also discussed how we would 
  need to create the hinge at the top of our metal tube connecting the reflector. We started to make some 
  sketches. We guessed that one of our biggest challanges would be attaching our extendable rod to the reflective
  tube, and we will need to work with the other tracking team to determine how to do this.

  ### Wednesday:

  Catherine and I continued our discussion of lead screws. We talked about how there would need to be 
  something that would prevent the screw from remaining still relative to the threaded rod. We started making 
  sketches for this.

 In addition, we made a prototype stepper motor powered lead screw. I built the cardboard backing that forced 
 the screw to move up and down while Catherine created the circuitry and program to control the motor. We also 
 experimented with quarter and half steps to create smoother motion. Our prototype was underconstrained, so it 
 was more wobbly and noisy than we would like our final design to be. We attempted to test how much weight our 
 prototype could hold. We did not have any weights however, so we were not able to determine this accurately. 
 We did manage to see that it was able to carry two full water bottles up and down, which is a good sign.

 Finally, we started to discuss the angles and lengths our rod would be at for the largest and smallest altitude
 angles for our reflector.
