  ## Week 11: 

  ### Monday:
  I helped Catherine model our lead screw device that can adjust altitude in Fusion 360. We also finished hashing 
  out how all the parts worked, and I learned more about how Fusion works.





  ### Wednesday:

  We realized that we had two different reflective tubes from an error at Home Depot. They had a different gauge, 
  and seemed to be finished using different processes. Christine and I attempted to determine which one was better 
  at reflecting infrared light (and would therefore be better for our solar cooker). 
  However, we could not find the FLIR camera, so we had to use the handheld detector. 
  Unfortunately, it was not able to measure the reflected temperature of the sky on the two tubes because it was too 
  cold. The detector just gave a reading of “- - - -”. Joel helped Christine and I to come to the conclusion that 
  this probably would not have a large effect on our solar cooker results.

  We also continued using CAD. I helped Catherine work on creating a model of our stepper motor so that we can 
  create a cover for it so our extendable rod would not twist or scratch the motor. I helped measure the parts. 
  Unfortunately, we ended up with some of the parts of our model not being centered correctly, so we still have to 
  work on creating our final model.






  ### Wednesday:

  Catherine and I started brainstorming how every part of the reflector would attach to one another. 
  In addition, we finalized the design.

  First, we discussed the options for connecting the lower hinge of our lead screw device to the reflective tube.
  We didn't know what support, if any, there was going to be at this point, so we had several ideas:

  We also discussed how the hinges would be placed in these options:

  We also discussed how we could design the upper hinge of the lead screw device that attaches to the reflector:

 Finally, I sketched my idea of what the final design is like:
